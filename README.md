This project simulates the operation of a vending machine using Java. The program allows users to select products, insert virtual money, complete purchases, and receive the correct change. 
Additionally, it monitors inventory levels, tracks the availability of items, and handles invalid actions like insufficient funds or items that are out-of-stock.
